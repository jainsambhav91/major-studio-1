    -  **Resource Dependence and Political Rights:**
    
       This is a combination of two datasets that evaluates the relationship between the resource-dependency of SSA countries with their political rights score. The hypothesis being that nations with a larger dependency on natural resources have governments that perform poorly and are more authoritarian.

       The data sources are:
       
       [Freedom House's Freedom in the World 2014 report] (https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/FIW2014%20Booklet.pdf): This report evaluates the state of freedom in 195 countries in terms of civil liberties and political rights. For both these indicators, a score ranging from 1-7 is assigned and an average of both scores determines the level of freedom in the country. 
            
       [World Development Indicators - Contribution of natural resources to gross domestic product] (http://wdi.worldbank.org/table/3.14): This WDI report by The World Bank lists down the contribution of natural resources(as a whole) to the GDP along with the contribution of individual resources such as oil, natural gas, coal and minerals.
