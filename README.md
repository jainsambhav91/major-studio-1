### The African Education Funnel
## A comparison of enrolent rates across different levels of education
> I am studying the state of education enrollment in the sub-saharan african countries because I want to find out how the enrollement rates at different levels of education correlate with the resource dependance and productivity in order to understand it's impact on the inequality levels in these countries. I am considering using the [education enrollments rates](http://data.uis.unesco.org/?queryid=142), [resource dependant rates](http://wdi.worldbank.org/table/3.14#) and [productivity rates](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?end=2015&start=1960) as my variables. My visualization is based on UNESCO Institute of Statistics and World Development Indicators data.
