## Data Review

1. Selected Data Source [1]
    -  **Resource Dependence and Political Rights:**  

       This is a combination of two datasets that evaluates the relationship between the resource-dependency of SSA countries with their political rights score. The hypothesis being that nations with a larger dependency on natural resources have governments that perform poorly and are more authoritarian.

       [Freedom House's Freedom in the World 2014 report] (https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/FIW2014%20Booklet.pdf):  
       This report evaluates the state of freedom in 195 countries in terms of civil liberties and political rights. For both these indicators, a score ranging from 1-7 is assigned and an average of both scores determines the level of freedom in the country. 
            
       [World Development Indicators - Contribution of natural resources to gross domestic product] (http://wdi.worldbank.org/table/3.14):  
       This WDI report by The World Bank lists down the contribution of natural resources(as a whole) to the GDP along with the contribution of individual resources such as oil, natural gas, coal and minerals.

       A study that suggests that resource abundance can be a blessing for countries with good institutions and a curse for those with bad institutions.

       Findings of this study on Africa show that natural resource dependence can have a serious negative impact on both democratic transition and democratic consolidation.

       This study critically evaluates the basis for the so-called resource curse to find that causality runs from weak institutions to resource-dependence since such countries are unlikely to develop non-primary production sectors.

    - [UNU WIDER World Income Inequality Database] (https://www.wider.unu.edu/sites/default/files/WIID/WIID_ver3_sept15_0.xls)  
      Building on the idea that institutional quality plays an important role in determining the inequality conditions of a country, I would like to see how the Gini index of the SSA nations compares with their political rights score and their dependence on natural resources, the hypothesis being that nations with high resource dependence may have poor governanace, and in turn are dealing with higher economic inequality.  
      This is the UNU WIDER dataset that summarizes the Gini Index for all countries across time.

    - [Transparency International Corruption Perception Index] (http://files.transparency.org/content/download/1857/12438/file/CPI2014_DataBundle.zip)  
      With the Political Rights Score, I would also like to see if the corruption measures of the resource-dependent nations are worse that those of less resource-dependent nations.  
      The Corruption Perceptions Index ranks countries and territories based on how corrupt their public sector is perceived to be. It is a combination of polls – drawing on corruption-related data collected by a variety of reputable institutions. 

    - [World Development Indicators - Unemployment Data] (http://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=2&series=SL.UEM.1524.ZS&country=)  
      Since extractive industries are more capital intensive and limit employment creation, I would like to see how the unemployment rates for the resource-deoendent nations fare as compared to other nations in African region.  
      This dataset from the World Development Indicators provides a list of unemployment rates for all countires for the past 5 year period.
      
3. Questions [1]
    - When it comes to the linkages between resource-dependence and institutional quality, both arguments are cited in the report - one suggesting that resource abundant countries tend to have poor governance and the other suggesting that only because of poor governance countires are pushed towards being more resource-dependent. Which of the two arguments does the report support?

The United Nations’ Gender Inequality Index is a composite measure that reflects inequality in achievement between men and women in three dimensions: reproductive health, empowerment and the labour market, where the lower the score, the closer the gender parity.

      This data captures the Gross National Incomes of countries and territories for the year 2014. The hypothesis behind choosing this data is that a higher level of gender inequality in a nation may lead to a lower gross national income, indicating a higher level of poverty.
