#### Refined questions for UNDP:
 Selected Data Source: [Enrollment Rate by Level of Education] (http://data.uis.unesco.org/?queryid=142)
  
  

**Questions**

1. The report provides many evidences of the poor post-primary education enrollment rates in Africa. It also discretely emphasizes on the high resource-dependenace of the SSA countries. Could we then compare the education-enrollment rates with resource-dependance rates to examine whether a poor post-primary education enrollment is a result of a lack of high-productivity, skilled labour market in Africa?

2. The report provides a comparison of education-enrollment rates between African countries and the rest of the world. Does it make sense to analyse the trend within the continent juxtapose the education-enrollment rates along with the GINI index in these countries? 

3. What findings or ideas triggered the analysis of the education sector in Africa by breaking it down into different levels of education enrollment.

1. Selected Data Source [1]
    -  **Resource Dependence and Political Rights:**  

       This is a combination of two datasets that evaluates the relationship between the resource-dependency of SSA countries with their political rights score. The hypothesis being that nations with a larger dependency on natural resources have governments that perform poorly and are more authoritarian.

       *Data sources:*
       
       [Freedom House's Freedom in the World 2014 report] (https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/FIW2014%20Booklet.pdf):  
       This report evaluates the state of freedom in 195 countries in terms of civil liberties and political rights. For both these indicators, a score ranging from 1-7 is assigned and an average of both scores determines the level of freedom in the country. 
            
       [World Development Indicators - Contribution of natural resources to gross domestic product] (http://wdi.worldbank.org/table/3.14):  
       This WDI report by The World Bank lists down the contribution of natural resources(as a whole) to the GDP along with the contribution of individual resources such as oil, natural gas, coal and minerals.

       This study critically evaluates the basis for the so-called resource curse to find that causality runs from weak institutions to resource-dependence since such countries are unlikely to develop non-primary production sectors.

    - [UNU WIDER World Income Inequality Database] (https://www.wider.unu.edu/sites/default/files/WIID/WIID_ver3_sept15_0.xls)  
      Building on the idea that institutional quality plays an important role in determining the inequality conditions of a country, I would like to see how the Gini index of the SSA nations compares with their political rights score and their dependence on natural resources, the hypothesis being that nations with high resource dependence may have poor governanace, and in turn are dealing with higher economic inequality.  
      This is the UNU WIDER dataset that summarizes the Gini Index for all countries across time.
      
    - [Tax Revenue as percentage of GDP - Table 11] (http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr_2015_statistical_annex.pdf)  
      Countries that are more dependent on natural resources may tend to have a lower tax revenue as a percentage of GDP since the economic power and control will be in the hands of a few. To test this hypothesis I would like to compare the resource dependence of countries with the tax collection percentage.

    - [Transparency International Corruption Perception Index] (http://files.transparency.org/content/download/1857/12438/file/CPI2014_DataBundle.zip)  
      With the Political Rights Score, I would also like to see if the corruption measures of the resource-dependent nations are worse that those of less resource-dependent nations.  
      The Corruption Perceptions Index ranks countries and territories based on how corrupt their public sector is perceived to be. It is a combination of polls – drawing on corruption-related data collected by a variety of reputable institutions. 

    - [World Development Indicators - Unemployment Data] (http://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=2&series=SL.UEM.1524.ZS&country=)  
      Since extractive industries are more capital intensive and limit employment creation, I would like to see how the unemployment rates for the resource-deoendent nations fare as compared to other nations in African region.  
      This dataset from the World Development Indicators provides a list of unemployment rates for all countires for the past 5 year period.
      
3. Questions [1]
    - When it comes to the linkages between resource-dependence and institutional quality, both arguments are cited in the report - one suggesting that resource abundant countries tend to have poor governance and the other suggesting that only because of poor governance countires are pushed towards being more resource-dependent. Which of the two arguments does the report support?

The United Nations’ Gender Inequality Index is a composite measure that reflects inequality in achievement between men and women in three dimensions: reproductive health, empowerment and the labour market, where the lower the score, the closer the gender parity.

    - [Pupil Teacher Ratio - UNDP Human Development Report Table 10] (http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr_2015_statistical_annex.pdf):  
      A possible reason for low student enrollment in Africa could also be a lack of schools and a unfavourable pupil teacher ratio. To explore this possibility, I would like to compare the student enrollment rates in these nations along with the student pupil ratio. The student pupil ratio is basically the  Average number of pupils per teacher in a given school year.  
      

    - [UNU WIDER World Income Inequality Database] (https://www.wider.unu.edu/sites/default/files/WIID/WIID_ver3_sept15_0.xls)  
      This is the UNU WIDER dataset that summarizes the Gini Index for all countries across time. With the idea that a weak education system will also lead to an economic inequality in the country, I would like to see how the student enrollment in schools compares with the Gini coefficients across African nations.
        
        
    - [World Development Indicators - Contribution of natural resources to gross domestic product] (http://wdi.worldbank.org/table/3.14):   
      A poor level of education in a country could also lead to the country being more dependent on natural resources. With this assumption, I would like to compare the quality of education/enrollment in schools with the dependence of countries on natural resources.  
      
      
3. Questions [3]
    - The study provides many evidences of lack of quality education in SSA countries, which is a major cause of inequality in these nations. Can this not be related to poor governanace as well?
    - Along with gender, education, demographics, resource-dependenace, were there any other factors that were studied to understand the reasons for inequality. Were they significant?
