# The African Education Funnel
## A Comparison of Enrollment Rates Across Different Levels of Education, and its Relationship to Inequality

#### Description:

Over the past decade, the primary school enrollment rate 
in sub-Saharan Africa has significantly improved, now averaging over 80%.
However, the poor secondary and tertiary enrollment rates are considerably restricting 
the region from moving its economy toward higher-productivity sectors.
This visualization establishes this gap between enrollment rates across African countries. 


#### Research Question:

> I am studying the state of education enrollment in the sub-saharan african countries because I want to find out how the enrollement rates at different levels of education correlate with the resource dependance and productivity in order to understand it's impact on the inequality levels in these countries. I am considering using the [education enrollments rates](http://data.uis.unesco.org/?queryid=142), [resource dependant rates](http://wdi.worldbank.org/table/3.14#) and [productivity rates](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?end=2015&start=1960) as my variables. My visualization is based on UNESCO Institute of Statistics and World Development Indicators data.
